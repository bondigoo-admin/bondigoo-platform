Implement comment functionality for connection requests
Add endpoints for fetching pending requests, accepted connections, and connection history

b. Enhance userController:

Update the user search functionality to only return coaches when searched by clients
Implement privacy settings to control profile visibility

c. Update bookingController:

Add a check to ensure that only connected clients can book sessions with a coach


Database Updates:

Add a 'comment' field to the Connection model
Add a 'visibility' field to the User model for privacy settings


API Updates:

Update connectionAPI.js to include new endpoints and functionality
Modify userAPI.js to respect new privacy settings and search restrictions


UI/UX Enhancements:
