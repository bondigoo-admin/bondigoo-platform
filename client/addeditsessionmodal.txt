Implementation Concept:

Create a separate component for each session type (e.g., OneOnOneForm, GroupSessionForm, etc.).
In the renderSessionTypeFields function:

Use a switch statement to determine which form component to render based on the selected session type.
Pass necessary props to each form component, including form data, error state, and change handlers.


Implement form validation specific to each session type within their respective components.
Use consistent UI components across all forms (e.g., Input, Select, Textarea from your UI library) for a unified look and feel.
Implement conditional rendering within each form for fields that depend on other input values (e.g., "Repeat Until" in Availability).
Use fieldsets to group related inputs together for better organization and accessibility.
Implement a reusable DateTimePicker component for start and end times, ensuring consistency across different session types.
Create a custom TagInput component for the suggested Tags field, allowing users to add and remove tags easily.
Use tooltips to provide additional information or explanations for fields that might need clarification.
Implement real-time validation and feedback, especially for interdependent fields (e.g., minimum and maximum attendees).

This concept provides a comprehensive structure for different session types and their fields, allowing for a flexible and detailed session creation process. The suggested additions can be implemented based on priority and user needs, potentially in future iterations of the feature.

Thank you for the additional context and guidance. Based on your feedback, I'll adjust the concept to make most fields optional and ensure we have all necessary information for session creation. Let's proceed with the implementation step-by-step.
First, regarding the file structure:

To keep the components folder organized, we should create a new folder specifically for these session-related components. Let's call it sessionForms within the components directory.
For the backend, we'll need to update the existing SessionType model and create a new Session model to accommodate the various session types and their specific fields.

Here's the plan:

Create a new folder: src/components/sessionForms
Create individual form components for each session type in this new folder
Update the AddEditSessionModal component to use these new form components
Update the backend models, routes, and controllers

Before proceeding with the code, I'd like to see the following files to ensure we're aligning with the existing structure and naming conventions:

server/models/SessionType.js
server/controllers/coachController.js (particularly the parts related to session management)
server/routes/coachRoutes.js

Once I have this information, I can provide a more accurate and cohesive implementation that fits seamlessly with your existing codebase.
Also, could you confirm if you want to keep the existing SessionType model as is (for defining types of sessions) and create a new Session model for actual session instances, or if you prefer to combine everything into a single model?
Lastly, regarding the fields for date and time for one-on-one sessions, you're absolutely right. We'll make sure to include these essential fields for all session types.
Please provide the requested files, and I'll proceed with the implementation based on your existing structure and conventions.
